The following tags are official and eligible for a copy to github.

REL-3-0-0 : Is to be compiled with any ciforth better than 5.4.0 ,
             Tested on ciforth riscv 6.0.0

PASS_5_4_0 : Is to be compiled with any ciforth 5.4.0 ,
    the 64 bit version passes regressiontest64
    the 32 bit version passes regressiontest32
The 64 bit version passes regressiontest64 on arm 64, except one.

REL-2-0-1 : MOVI|X, enahnced by xx:MOVI|X, for 64 bits.
This label is not yet assigned, until we are happy with how the
optimiser works after this change.

REL-2-0-0 : Version officially released on my hcc website and github,
also used for optimiser.

PASS32_5_3_0 : Is to be compiled 32 bit with any ciforth 5.3.0 ,
    64 bit with 2017oct beta.
    lina32 : passes the regression test as such.
    lina64 beta 2019feb04 : Passes test-target resgressiontest64
       [test.bin has a different labelname in test.bin, considered cosmetic.
       rf751.asm passes assembly/disassembly, but failed in crawling. ]

REL-1-1-0: elaborate test for lina32 5.3.0, assemblers work voor lina64
  grand cleanup
LINA531_OK : with lina32 5.3.1 the regressiontest target succeeds.
 (must still be created as per 2016 may 20) (dubious)
LAST_FOR_LINA4: The last version that works with lina 4.0.6/4.0.7
REL-1-0-0: debianized and published on hcc page.

        MULTLABEL:        }

CLASS : classes used instead of structs
LDETECT : detecting and usage of label names within -dl disassembly.
           RCSVERSION in ``make''ing of tests.
REGRESSDIS : handles the regression tests for test.bin and lina, and
             is able to create a reasonable value for rf751.asm, that
             not yet assembles.

MULTLABELS : labeldis prints all labels for the same address.
             the testciasdis target succeeds, also for rf751.

RF751_COMPLETE : rfcrawl.cul with rf751equ.cul contains basically
                 al reverse engineering information now.

TSTCMP_RCS : all testresults are in RCS now (practically)
             elaborate test of SIB via LEAX, (all three offsets).

TESTAS49 : all tests for assemblers work again, including 6809
         and alpha. But those are using asgen.frt 4.9.1.1.

REGRESSION_FULL : test for all assemblers and the ciasdis targets build
    for make target regressiontest, and succeed.
