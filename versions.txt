                    MILESTONES
LINA531_OK : with lina32 5.3.1 the regressiontest target succeeds.
 (must still be created as per 2016 may 20)
CLASS : classes used instead of structs
LDETECT : detecting and usage of label names within -dl disassembly.
           RCSVERSION in ``make''ing of tests.
REGRESSDIS : handles the regression tests for test.bin and lina, and
             is able to create a reasonable value for rf751.asm, that
             not yet assembles.

MULTLABELS : labeldis prints all labels for the same address.
             the testciasdis target succeeds, also for rf751.

RF751_COMPLETE : rfcrawl.cul with rf751equ.cul contains basically
                 al reverse engineering information now.

TSTCMP_RCS : all testresults are in RCS now (practically)
             elaborate test of SIB via LEAX, (all three offsets).

TESTAS49 : all tests for assemblers work again, including 6809
         and alpha. But those are using asgen.frt 4.9.1.1.

REGRESSION_FULL : test for all assemblers and the ciasdis targets build
    for make target regressiontest, and succeed.
