How to bring up an assembler.

1. identify the mnemonics and get the masks right, i.e. the bits
   that have not been filled in by the instruction

2. define all mnemonics for fixup.

3. Run SHOW-ALL.
   Inspect for postits that are not wanted.
   Use bad bits for supressing those.

4. Debug "make testas<processor>"
  This can fail because contrary to SHOW: it doesn't use
  backtracking.
  This means:
    All fixups must be defined prior to corresponding mnemonics,
    such that they are inspected later.
    A fixup in the wrong place can result in the instruction not
    properly disassembled, mostly it will fail and fall back into byte
    disassembly. This can be remedied by properly adjusting more bad
    bits.
