\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 2016 may 24 : look into this :

1. Fill in execution tokens handled by NEW-PIFU
2. renaming DSP @ EXECUTE --> display etc.
  passing execution tokens during creation, instead of filling them in.
3. renaming >DSP to specifiy-display
4. rethinking %
5. making vocabularies no more immediate, compatible with 5.0
6. make it run on version 5 using `` WANT -version4- ''
7. get rid of REMEMBER
8. explicit linked list instead of using the dictionary.
This will result in >%NEXT making the next PIFU current,
skipping the -- names, and make IS-PIFU superfluous.
9. run a test with version 5 wina
10. cleanup the makefile, w.r.t. disassembly
11. check that show-all for 386 pentium combined doesn't
 show more than 386 and pentium separately.

- make the target gsetall work for 64 bits.
- make the target rf751cul work for 64 bits.
- make a mechanism for debian archives
2018 sep 4
After `` make clean '' and `` make regressiontest '' all seem okay.

Bug:
    MOV, F| AX'| R| BX|
    accepts
    N'|

    although the bits for N'| are hanging out of the bit fields
    that are acceptable.
solved in asi386.frt  4.30

Bug: STx| as a possible target for POP, no longer a problem.

Make rf751 gives a phase error for tib, because there is
TIB in Forth itself. This could be remedied by defining
rftib instead of tib. This has been tried but not put back
in the archive.

2018 sep 4
Fiddling around with asi86.frt
The conclusion is that it is not a good idea to get rid of the
fake bits that hang outside the area that is changed.
This is a very flexible mechanism and it is hard to replace it
by extra bad bits, because the instruction that used the fake
bit would have one bad flag, and *all* other instructions
potentially need the conflicting bad flag.
I coint the term ghost bit for the bits that hanging out.

2018 sep 6
It is disturbing that bits are not in the correct order,
or that mask bits are not corresponding to the order of
postit or fixup, or that ghost bits are not at the position
in the mask compared to where they are in the tally.
This can be remedied if the postits are in memory order.
Then the fixup from behind and the mask corresponding to the postits
can be in memory order. Both must be applied from the end of the
instruction, which is no biggy. This accomodates ghost bits
that are before the start of the instruction.
Fixups from the front can have a ghost bit, provided they are
applied from the back. This can be accomodated if the size of the
fixup is known. So we need 1FI and 2FI instead of xFI.
This again is no biggy.

-------------------------------
To go in the doc

Every two operand instruction has a primary register fixup
either like AX'| or AL'|. Not counting as two operand instructions
are those that have an implied register AX or an immediate data.
Mostly also a T| or F| is needed wich means to or from the primary
operand. This is not applicable for i.a. LEA, and XCHG, instructions.

The 64 bit prefix is   Q'.[ and L'.[
Q means 64 bits operation, L 32 bits.
' means the primary operand is taken from the extended set
. means the unprimed operand is taken from the extended set
] means the index register is taken from the extended set.
Any combination is possible. Q: means just 64 bits without
extended registers.
Example
Q'[ LEA, AX'| [BX] means that both are from the extended set
Q.  MOV, T| AX'| X| BX| means that BX| is from the extended set.
Q: is instead of a lone Q
------------------------------

What we must get rid off is the cludge64.
However it is pretty easy to fixup from behind.
XOR a byte at `` HERE 1- '' then `` 8 RSHIFT '' until zero.

Furthermore. The conclusion is that V| and X| are proper normal
xFI's while AX| is done from behind.
However whenever ghost bits are necessary it is easiest to
fixup from behind.

So the battle plan is to define FIR' that is as simple as possible
and 32/64 bit clean. Then introduce that everywhere, then
rename.

I gotrid of B'| W'| in asi86.frt (asi86.frt 4.11).

sep 8
There is  only one way, make a reasonable architectural
description. Then adapt the code to that.

2018 sep 11
It makes no sense to get rid of B'| . The B| bit is at the end
of the first byte of one, the first byte of two, or the
second byte of three. Having B| as a fixup of the paenultimate
byte is then the best idea. This leaves us with B'| for some
instructions like IN OUT and string instructions.

Y'| N'| came up spuriously. This has been solved by introducing
8000,0000 bad bit to conflict with B| N|

2018 sep 14
It turns out there were already bad bits for Y'| !
To wit 400/800 . Introducing those passes all tests.

2018 sep 15
The conclusion is that the internal format of pifu's must be
documented. Then strive towards defining the data such that
it can be filled in from the least significant bytes
from the higher towards the lower addresses.
- This is easy,
- the bi masks are always compatible
- ghost bits are at their natural place
- the printiout is compatible with Intel documentation/
 memory byte order

2018 oct 1
It appears to be really cumbersome to make incremental
changes.

2018 oct 2
This is the plan:
Add a 1PI` that is using the new approach.
Add a FIR` that is using the new approach.
Make 1PI's without ghost bits use 1PI`
Make FIR's that are used only on 1PI's use FIR`
This should be sufficient to convert as80.frt.

We can separate between 4PI and xFI DFI and the rest.
This can be accomodated by L, and the like.
This means that for the moment asalpha just remains
working.
A possible problem is the DFI for 6809.

2018 oct 4
A version that is stable and passes all tests is called 1-1-0.
If 1-2 fails, this will be the one presented to Debian.
The idea is to have CORRECT-NEW that will inverse the order of
bytes within the length prescribed by ISL.
The entry will be corrected upon PI (creation) then the new version
is used.

2018 oct 5
The trick to have the BI filled in with data that can be ored in from behind
has succeeded.
The ghost bit must be separated out into a separate field.
We need two global adjusters ; ghost-pt and isl-pt.
ghost-pt is the stuff hanging outboard and usl-pt is what we
expect the instruction length to be.

2018 oct 7
At last there is a plan:
 write a document where it is explained how to handle the
 big-endian/small-endian and firxup from behind issues.

Introduce a good bit instead of a ghost bit. Because good bits
must agree between the postit and the reverse pickups they can be corrected
one by one.
Starting with asi86.frt

2018 oct 8
asi86.frt works with target testas86.
Work underway for asi386.frt
It is discovered that there is another testtarget : gset86.
This failed because of two remaining defects in the GO mechanism.
asgen.frt,v 4.66 asi86.frt,v 4.13 pass all tests for the 8086.
Testing a 64 bit version of lina: the memory must be increased
to 64 Mbyte.
Then the target testasses succeeds.
Now we can eliminate cludge from asgen.frt too (done).
The whole regressiontest succeeds.

Next: using FIR's in their natural order.
This is only relevant to multiple byte FIR's.
as6809.frt : only one byte FIR's
as80.frt asalpha.frt : no FIR
asi86.frt : only one byte FIR's
asi386.frt : only two byte FIR's are
1| V| / CRx| DRx| / F| B| / Y'| LE'|
asipentium : only two byte FIR's are
u| m|  / s| d| / 16| 32|

2018 oct 9
The whole regressiontest succeeds even for 64 bit lina 5.3.0.
The rf751 lina405 and test.asm have small problems, more
related to the use of ciasdis than with defects in ciasdis.

With a few adaptations, the opcode sheets for 8080
6809 and 8086 succeed however there is a shift and the
makefile is not correct. The file need for x.ps is
x.frt but that is not automatically made.
This was sufficient success to check in ps.frt 4.3.

2018 oct 11
I must cleanup, throwing away experiments and superfluous files.
A terrible cleanup has been done, with lot of stuf sorted
into subdirectories.

One year later!

2019 oct 11
The plan :
- cleanup to the point that all targets succeed with 32 and 64 bit.
- a debian release for 64 bit.
What doesn't work:
  target rf751
  gset* , but mostly it is constants that are off
What works is for 32 and 64 bits:
   make testasses

2019 oct 13
The problem with the differences is that they are not problematic
1. START 1+  versus :L04FF    een gegenereerd label
2. V_base defined another time, leading to
    ( 0804,87AF )   :V_base :V_base   dl 0A
3.

What is a real bug is that the target rf751.asm fails for 64 bit.
On 32 bit we get a phase error on tib. This has nothing to do
with the existance of TIB in forth itself.

make regressiontest FORTH=/usr/bin/lina
succeeds. Maybe a phase error but that is all.

make regressiontest
use the local lina. That passes testasses.
It fails the gsetall target, constants are printed incorrectly
such as C instead of 18.

2019 oct 14
The random data was in fact the offset of the commaer in the disassembly.
Divide by the cell size and multiply by 4 gives the same result on
64 bits. Now gsetall works for 64 bit and only fails on 32 bit for
gsetalpha because CALL_PAL requires a 64 bit constant.

The target rf751.asm still fails on 64 bits, not on 32 bits.
However with a proper cul file the 64 can disassemble rf751
correctly. Also it can assemble it correctly.
So the problem is in crawling the rf751 executable.
This is not a priority.
It is "solved" by adding a target regressiontest64 that require
less of rf751.
2019 oct 15
label PASS32_5_3_0 is is a version where all tests pass for
the ciasdis such as compile using the official 5.3.0 release.
The test comparison for gsetalpha is incorrect but passes.
An improvement is made to asgen.frt such that lina as used
in this directory works: AMDX86 ciforth beta 2019Feb04
The test comparison for gsetalpha is corrected to work with
64 bits.
2019 oct 16
asalpha.frt used a hanging out bit. It is now replaced by the
GO mechanism which required extending that in asgen.frt.
Test for asalpha now pass on 32 bits.
2019 oct 17
There is an asAMD.frt added and a target ciasdis64 in the Makefile.
The label PASS32_5_3_0 is moved to the new versions.

2019 oct 18
This version of ciasdis can be released.
This version 2.0 is a extensable assembler/ disassembler for Intel 86
The binary is intended for 32 bit i86. It can handle 16 bit segments
so it can be used for 8086. After loading asAMD.frt it can handle
64 bits. You can do complicated disassemblies -- such as wirlpools
of code, data and text -- using scripts; extracting names from the
binary to show up in disassemblies.
As an example a compiler rf751 is disassembled. It has
over 200 transition between code, data and text segments.
The debian archive comes for two architectures i386 and AMD64.

Sources are in github. Compilation of the 32 bit version requires
lina 32 bits 5.3.0 (or compatible version of ciforth for the
other 32 bit Intel based OS's).
Compilation of the 64 bit version requires lina64 bits beta of 2017oct29.

The tag PASS32 is moved to the latest checkedin version of CVS.
Introduced a file with CIASVERSION that figures in ENVIRONMENT.
The target srczip works but it is not clear that it is any good,
in particular some files are missing such as asalpha.frt.
The completion for J, was wrong, because TALLY-GO was not saved in
SHOW-COMPLETION. Fixed.

2019 oct 20
Clean up of text files in preparation of copying to github.
2019 oct 21
THose updated text are added and form release 2.0.0

2019 oct 26
Adding 64 bit stuff and using it to disassemble lina64 5.3.0
has succeeded.

2019 oct 27
Cleanup of ciasdis before formally adding asAMD.frt. This includes
64 bit facilities around Q : -dq- {Q,} that are not yet used.
Mysterious problems were caused by symbolic links in the cvs repository,
like the impossibility to burn down readme in favour of readme.txt.
All symbolic links in the repository have been solved.

2019 oct 30
A problem is that the code is deciphered in the 32 bits mode,
such that e.g. REL| is not recognized.

The idea is that switching to 16 bit mode is rare.
If it is done after the section we must switch back.

On the other hand 32 or 64 bit mode is permanent.
One or the other is choosen. If there is a switch between
the two that must be added in the consult file.
Still there might be needed a difference in the consult file
between the dc32 and dc64. Until such time the disassembly
uses the current mode, and doesn't switch it.

The problem with REL| is that it is not encountered at the
right position in the pifu list. This can be alleviated
only in the most artificial manner, unless it is put in the asi386.frt
source file. Also the switches for 32 and 64 bit become clearer
then.

2019 oct 31
Made 1 byte prefixes a special postit: 1PIP.
Prefixes now appear on the same line, which amounted to adding a condition
to ADORN-ADDRESS. In asi386.frt instructions are recognizable as
prefixes. All tests pass, but of course the testoutput changes.
.

2019 nov 1
Cleaned up the handling of BITS-32/BITS-64. There is now a
START-DIRECTIVE that can be filled in with such.
The crawling of test rf and lina have been adapted to used
that.

Although ciasdis can handle only a single section, where the
elf header is part of, at least the comment around ORG and
code-buffers have been cleared up.

2019 nov 2
ADORN-ADDRESS crashes if there is no current pifu.
Fixed by testing for zero.

2019 nov 3
The correct disassemblies for 32 versus 64 mode were not
found. This was caused by not testing the BA bit in DIS-PI.
Now the INC|X, instruction e.g. was found in 64 bit mode
and later disapprover, leading to byte disassembly.
One nit still remains. Somehow SHOW-ALL leaves out CLTS,
the instruction immediately before the Q: stuff.
This is noted and the regressiontest is made not to fail.

2019 nov 5
A target lina530.asm has been added to the Makefile of ciasdis
that allows to disassemble and reassemble a 64 bit binary.
<<<<<<< log.txt

2019 nov 11
The regressiontest succeeds for the default 5.3.0 lina
regressiontest64 succeeds for the 64 bit Forth in this directory.
Introduced MOVI|Q, to replace MOVI|X, for 64 bits Intel.

2020 aug 10
The regressiontest with FORTH=< lina 32 5.3.0 > runs with splendour.
The plan is to add the MOVI|Q, instruction in the 64 bit set to
hide the MOVI|X, instruction in 64 bit mode.
(owever the same test with a 64 bit Forth crashes. check probablty
documented.)

2020 aug 11
The remarks of ciasdis64 directory that is coupled to the
optimiser are integrated, and this is the new release that accomodates
the MOVI|Q, .. IQ, instruction.
However MOVI|Q, is a bad idea. See the log of ciforth itself
introducing E:MOVI|X,  Q:MOVI|X,  .

2020 aug 13
The conclusion is that there is one thing to do, stop assigning
a special meaning to MOVI|X, within the optimiser that doesn't
agree with the actual meaning.
The next thing is to know what a prefix E: Q: does to a MOVI|X, .
It turns out that only if preceeded by a Q: the MOVI|X, takes
a 64 bit immediate value. So the policy becomes to have an E:
prefix as long as we're manipulating 32 bit values in a movi.
This way the decompilation is correct, not so the execution
in subtle cases such as sign extension.
However the intermediate code is not executed.
A prefix E: does nothing to a MOVI|X, except maybe a ghost
register. This means it can be introduced gratuitously and removed
later for non-ghost registers.
Furthermore Q.:MOVI|X, is needed and requires a 64 bit immediate.
The consequence is that MOVI|X, is use
We need the bad bits to disciminate between 32 and 64 bits
through BITS-64. This disallows Q:MOVI|X, in 32 bits mode.
A bit for 32 bits mode remains and it may be useful some time,
but not for now.

2020 aug 15
There was the idea to have the Q prefixes generate the same code
for E: temporarily for the optimiser. This doesn't work because
now all the disassemblies of the low level code fail.
So we must just start the tedious work of introducing the E:
prefix manually at the places in front of the movi|x, where the
data is just 32 bits. The rule is that tempory code inside the optimiser
interprets E#: MOVI|X, as pertaining to 64 bits data.
Should ever the need arise to have an e: prefix in combination with
MOVI to pertain to 32 bit data E#: MOVI, can be used.

2020 aug 16
In the optimiser the output of E: MOVI, is Q: MOVI, because the
data is 32 bit anyhow.

HIATUS!

2022 feb 18
Updating to lina 5.4.0 :
2>R must be added to the WANT's, no longer invisibly
included through FORMAT.

2022 feb 27
Done an experiment. All decompilation range can be removed
from the output.

2022 apr 11
regressiontest works in 5.4.0 lina 32
regressiontest64 works in 5.4.0 lina 64
regressiontest64 fails in 5.4.0 ciarm 64 but only in
lina405.asm and lina530.asm
The update to be done was small: only ABORT"
was used in some obscure files.

2022 apr 14
Tag PASS_5_4_0 is ready to be copied to github.

2022 jul 25
In the file asAMD.frt the startcode for the Q series is wrong.
This will not be detected by tests, because this has been fetched
from asi386.frt

2023 jan 23
All labels appearing in lina530.asm between _start and _end , and
all ranges can be removed. The resulting file assembles.
Not only this the file can be relocated.

2023 jan 30
There was a provision to get rid of a duplication for e.g. douser.
CLEAN-LABELS do that.

2023 may 17
The regressiontest fails with release 5.5
(;CODE) is suspect.
No! The Forth was not big enough. No problems with 60 Mbyte.

2025 oct 4
Do not use % to denote binary, because it is used to signal
dea's used as struct or maybe class. Use %% instead.

2025 oct 20
CSRRW, doesnot disassemble properly.
After all the components are found (they are), the fixup from
sd9#| leaves 1F00,0000 in TALLY-BI signalling that the disassembly
failed.
It is mysterious that DFI succeeds in asalpha.frt
Replacing DFIs by DFI doesn't help.
2025 oct 21
Debugging the bad bits, now the system is in place, but the
disassembly has to be checked against the gnu assembler.
Saved an assembler disassembler for riscv into the ciasdis archive.
Next move to be done in a riscv system.

2025 oct 23
Testing on sinas2. Making testasriscv succeeds.
There is no problem for byte order compared to Intel.
However the target 386 to alpha fail.

2025 oct 25
Make all targets work on riscv. That is to say sinas2
Done.
2025 oct 26
* remove duplicate fixup for the m.s. bits
* gdb installed
* disassemble riscv.bin by gdb and check.
  This doesn't succeed, however we can use objdump "
    objdump -b binary -mriscv --adjust-vma=0x1000 -D *bin

The fixed code for MUL and MULW were not correct.   ?
LD and LW were swapped.
Apparently objdump -bin cannot handle mulw .. remuw.
The opcode for SRAW was wrong, shadowed by another SRA.
2025 oct 27
The shift mask must accomodate 6 bits for 64 bits.
This also fixes the duplicate entries of SB .. SH and LW
in the testset.
Handling the deviation.s fails because the disassembly generates
an unending row of --""--. This is caused by no instruction
matching the memory. TALLY-BI remains at zero, making AT-REST?
think that all bits are reset to zero. Solved by inspecting the
size of bag DISS.
There was a provision for aligning instruction at 4 bytes,
added to asriscv.frt.
Made a file deviation.s with instructions that has not been checked
yet. It looks that there maybe different instructions are generated
by the same opcode.
ADDIW was missing. Updating testsetriscv so that the
duplicate entries of SB .. SH in the testset are removed.

Later I doscovered that testcmp/gsetriscv was not updated in cox.
(For ciasdis was not made). This test had later been done in sinas2
and succeeds.)

------------------

;CODE is not needed in ciasdis : remove
    - % is used to give a dea where fields are used.
       replace by ' wherever an ct is meant.
With 6.0 it is no longer needed to redefine BAG
