In the documentation there is a need to warn for redefinitions.

The -dc- thingies should be generated with a automatic tool.

MAKE-CUL should print symbolic names for ranges where possible

There is some worry because QSORT can't handle empty ranges
(or so it seems).


A lone EQU leads to a not unique warning in the second pass.
If a label is defined using EQU the not-unique-message
should be supressed.

Byte offsets should be signed. Maybe all offsets should be signed.

Introduce AS-@+ .

ORG is a mess. It clears the code buffer, so it should only be issued
at the start of a segment. -ORG- changes the association with the
start of the segment. This is a bad idea, it just means that we are
entering a different segment.

We need a don't care segment that is not analysed, because it contains
don't care items.

WHERE-LABEL and CLEAN-LABEL require sortedness. This should be a permanent
and maintained property such that the use cannot be accidentally wrong.

The name SEGMENT is all wrong. It should be called SECTION !!

------------------------ WISH-LIST ---------------------------------

 There could be a priority to cul-items. If there is an overruling
priority the lower priority would give way.
Example: disassembling at priority 1 hits a data area with priority
0. The disassembling stop there.
Disassembling at priority 1 would stop at an unknown instruction,
at priority 0 it would not.

------------------------ REPORTED ---------------------------------

The colorforth crew reports that there is a space missing after
RB, (resulting in collated comment RB,\ )
Solution: end ID-NO() with a SPACE .

----------------------- AFTER 2018 ----------------------
Confirmed per 2018 sep 4
The 8080 assembler allows things as
MOV M'| M|
PUSH SP
LDAX HL
because no BAD bit at all are used in the thingies.

Completion now works generally ok with one exception:
  [MEM expects tally bits surviving the SIB instruction,
  but after `` LEA, AX'| ZO| [MEM '' SHOW-COMPLETION
  doesn't work. ( error 28)
  This looks most like a bug in the 386 assembler than the
  generic system.
Not so easy involves sib-byte.

There is a problem around the disassembly of variables like
base and h0 in rf751.asm

make gsetalpha is different in 32 and 64 bit mode.
Almost nothing works in 64 bits.

rf751 gives a phase error on tib. This can be ignored.
It is not understood either. It has nothing to do with the
existance of a word TIB in the kernel of Forth.
.

The greatest problem is that in fact the format of the
data in the PIFU's is not documented.
