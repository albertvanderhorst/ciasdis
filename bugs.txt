In the documentation there is a need to warn for redefinitions.

The -dc- thingies should be generated with a automatic tool.

MAKE-CUL should print symbolic names for ranges where possible

There is some worry because QSORT can't handle empty ranges
(or so it seems).


A lone EQU leads to a not unique warning in the second pass.
If a label is defined using EQU the not-unique-message
should be supressed.

Byte offsets should be signed. Maybe all offsets should be signed.

Introduce AS-@+ .

ORG is a mess. It clears the code buffer, so it should only be issued
at the start of a segment. -ORG- changes the association with the
start of the segment. This is a bad idea, it just means that we are
entering a different segment.

We need a don't care segment that is not analysed, because it contains
don't care items.

WHERE-LABEL and CLEAN-LABEL require sortedness. This should be a permanent
and maintained property such that the use cannot be accidentally wrong.

The name SEGMENT is all wrong. It should be called SECTION !!

------------------------ WISH-LIST ---------------------------------

 There could be a priority to cul-items. If there is an overruling
priority the lower priority would give way.
Example: disassembling at priority 1 hits a data area with priority
0. The disassembling stop there.
Disassembling at priority 1 would stop at an unknown instruction,
at priority 0 it would not.
